# Hobogo
Unfinished experimentation with Rust+WASM for making an AI for the game Hobogo.

Hobogo is a a pencil-and-paper board game played on a 7x7 grid. Each player has a mark (e.g. X and O) and take turns making a move. You can only make a move on a cell if the eight neighboring cells do not have more enemies than friends.
